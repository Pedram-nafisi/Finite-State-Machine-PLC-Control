# Finite State Machine â€“ PLC Project (Structured Text)

This project demonstrates a **Finite State Machine (FSM)** implementation using **Structured Text (ST)** to control a conveyor and an industrial robot system in a PLC environment.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

The system simulates a basic automated station with the following sequence:

1. **Auto Start** is triggered by an operator.
2. Conveyor is turned on to move an object into position.
3. A **proximity sensor** detects the object after a timer delay.
4. Conveyor stops and a **robot** is activated.
5. Once the robot finishes its task, the system returns to the initial state.

This logic is implemented as a **state-based system (FSM)** using a variable `Stage` and `CASE` logic in Structured Text.
